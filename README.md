# KSP-2-Music-In-KSP

Adds music from KSP 2 into KSP using Soundtrack Editor Forked.

Make sure you have [Soundtrack Editor Forked](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/191467-112x-soundtrack-editor-forked/) and its dependencies first.

Soundtrack Editor Forked will create 2 new folders in your KSP directory, Playlists and Music. Put the playlists.cfg file into the Playlists folder, and the music folders for each planet into the music folder.
